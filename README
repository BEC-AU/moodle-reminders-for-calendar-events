== Introduction ==


== Installation ==
1. Fetch the plug-in either of possible locations.
     + Goto https://github.com/isuru89/moodle-reminders-for-calendar-events and download the 
       repository as a zip file.
2. Goto the Moodle root directory and go inside 'local' directory.
3. Create a folder named 'reminders'.
4. Now extract the downloaded zip file inside to this folder. After it is extracted,
    all files and folders must compliance with given structure as shown in above.
5. Log into the Moodle site as the admin user. Usually the new plug-in must be identified
    and notified you when logged-in. If not then goto Site Administration -> Notifications
    to install the local plug-in.
6. Now you can change the plug-in specific settings via Site Administration -> Plugins -> Local Plugins -> Reminders.

== Configurations ==
If you want to change the cron cycle frequency, open the version.php file in the plug-in's root
directory and change the value for $plugin->cron. This value must be indicated by seconds. The
default value is 3600 seconds (i.e. 1 hour).
This frequency will be affected to the performance of Moodle cron system. Too much small value
will be an additional overhead while large value will be a problem of flooding the message
interface because of trying to send too many reminders at once.

== More Info ==
